## Introduction

Editing data tables interactively is a common requirement in **Shiny applications**. However, implementing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** manually can be complex and time taking. The **DTEdit** package simplifies this by extending **DT** to allow users to add, modify, and delete rows seamlessly.

In this post, we will explore **DTEdit**, how to use it in Shiny apps, its key features, and real-world use cases.

## What is DTEdit?

**DTEdit** is an R package designed to provide an editable **DT** table in **Shiny**. It enables users to interactively manage tabular data without requiring complex server-side logic.

### Why Use DTEdit?

-   **User-friendly data editing**: Allows non-technical users to edit datasets directly.
-   **Built-in validation**: Ensures data integrity.
-   **Database integration**: Can connect to SQL databases for persistent data storage.

## Getting Started with DTEdit

### Installation

To install **DTEdit**, use the following commands:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jwilber/dtedit")
```

### Basic Implementation in Shiny

Below is a simple **Shiny app** demonstrating **DTEdit**:



## Advanced Features of DTEdit

### Customizing Inputs

DTEdit allows custom input types, such as dropdowns or checkboxes, to be used for data entry.

### Data Validation

You can define validation rules to prevent incorrect data entries.

### Database Integration

DTEdit can be connected to a **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite** database to persist user edits.
